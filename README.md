# VISUADL

Welcome to the **VISUADL**! This repository is organized into multiple projects aimed at teaching deep learning concepts from the ground up, combining practical Python implementations, interactive visualizations, and online tutorials. Each project focuses on a unique aspect of deep learning education.

## Repository Structure

### 1. `dl_from_scratch`
A Python approach to building deep learning algorithms from scratch. This project demonstrates the underlying mechanics of popular deep learning models, using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning for structured code. 

- **Technologies**: Python, PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning
- **Goal**: Build core deep learning algorithms and models from scratch, step by step.

### 2. `visuadl`
A website designed to teach deep learning through animations and interactive content. This project is an online tutorial space where visitors can engage with deep learning concepts via visualizations built with HTML, CSS, and Anime.js.

- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, Anime.js
- **Goal**: Provide a visual and interactive understanding of deep learning principles.

### 3. `animations`
This folder contains Python scripts using Manim to generate animations for visualizing deep learning concepts. These animations are either used on the website or included in other learning resources.

- **Technologies**: Python, Manim
- **Goal**: Generate animations that enhance the learning experience by illustrating complex concepts.

### 4. `notebooks`
A collection of Jupyter Notebooks for study, testing, and experimentation. These notebooks cover various deep learning topics and provide hands-on exercises.

- **Technologies**: Python, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Goal**: Experiment with different deep learning techniques and tools for educational purposes.
